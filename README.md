# 🌱 Tree Planting Protocol  

### **Revolutionizing Tree Plantation with Blockchain & NFTs**  

## 🏆 Why This Project Matters  

Deforestation and environmental degradation are among the biggest challenges of our time. Governments and organizations run plantation drives, but verifying their impact remains difficult. **Tree Planting Protocol** leverages **blockchain technology** to create a **verifiable and transparent record of tree plantations** worldwide.  

This mobile application allows users to **document tree plantations**, mint them as **NFTs**, and display them on a **public map** for verification. This not only encourages individuals to plant trees but also holds them accountable, ensuring long-term sustainability.  

## 🌍 Key Features  

### ✅ **Proof of Plantation via NFTs**  
- Users plant a tree and enter details such as **latitude, longitude, and species**.  
- A **blockchain-based NFT** is minted as proof of plantation.  
- NFTs ensure **tamper-proof verification** of real-world tree plantations.  

### 🗺️ **View Nearby Trees on a Map**  
- Users can **explore** already minted trees in their vicinity.  
- The map view promotes community engagement by making it easy to track plantation efforts.  

### 🔍 **Decentralized Verification**  
- Anyone can visit a location and **verify the existence** of a tree.  
- This **crowdsourced verification model** prevents false claims and ensures real-world impact.  

### 🪦 **Mark Trees as Dead**  
- If a tree dies due to natural or human causes, it can be **marked as dead** to keep records accurate.  
- This ensures transparency and **accountability in sustainability efforts**.
